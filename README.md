# WireMock Spring Boot

WireMock Spring Boot drastically simplifies testing HTTP clients in **Spring Boot** & **Junit 5** based integration tests.

> **Warning**
> Project is in development stage, artifacts are not yet published to Maven Central.

## ü§© Highlights

- fully declarative [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) setup
- support for multiple `WireMockServer` instances - one per HTTP client as recommended in the WireMock documentation
- automatically sets Spring environment properties
- does not pollute Spring application context with extra beans

## ü§î How to use

Add the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.maciejwalkowiak</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock-spring-boot</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Use `@EnableWiremock` with `@ConfigureWiremock` with tests annotated that use `SpringExtension`, like `@SpringBootTest`:

```java
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@EnableWiremock({
        @ConfigureWiremock(name = "user-service", property = "user-client.url")
})
class TodoControllerTests {

    @Wiremock("user-service")
    private WireMockServer wiremock;

    @Test
    void aTest() {
        wiremock.stubFor(...);
    }
}
```

- `@EnableWiremock` adds test context customizer and enables `WireMockSpringExtension` 
- `@ConfigureWiremock` creates a `WireMockServer` and passes the `WireMockServer#baseUrl` to a Spring environment property with a name given by `property`.
- `@Wiremock` injects `WireMockServer` instance to a test

Note that `WireMockServer` instances are not added as beans to Spring application context to avoid polluting it with test-related infrastructure. Instead, instances are kept in a separate store associated with an application context.
